# Estimate the the standard deviation of the observation error

This function estimates the the standard deviation of the observation
error using the estimator proposed by Maissoro et al. (2024) .

## Usage

``` r
estimate_sigma(
  data,
  idcol = NULL,
  tcol = "tobs",
  ycol = "X",
  t = c(1/4, 1/2, 3/4)
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A `data.table` (or `data.frame`), a `list` of `data.table` (or
  `data.frame`), or a `list` of `list`.

  - If `data.table`: It should contain the raw curve observations in at
    least three columns.

    - `idcol` : The name of the column containing the curve index in the
      sample. Each curve index is repeated according to the number of
      observation points.

    - `tcol` : The name of the column with observation points associated
      with each curve index.

    - `ycol` : The name of the column with observed values at each
      observation point for each curve index.

  - If `list` of `data.table`: In this case, each element in the `list`
    represents the observation data of a curve in the form of a
    `data.table` or `data.frame`. Each `data.table` contains at least
    two columns.

    - `tcol` : The name of the column with observation points for the
      curve.

    - `ycol` : The name of the column with observed values for the
      curve.

  - If `list` of `list`: In this case, `data` is a list where each
    element is the observation data of a curve, given as a `list` of two
    vectors.

    - `tcol` : The vector containing observation points for the curve.

    - `ycol` : The vector containing observed values for the curve.

- idcol:

  `character`. If `data` is given as a `data.table` or `data.frame`,
  this is the name of the column that holds the curve index. Each curve
  index is repeated according to the number of observation points. If
  `data` is a `list` of `data.table` (or `data.frame`) or a `list` of
  `list`, set `idcol = NULL`.

- tcol:

  `character`. The name of the column (or vector) containing the
  observation points for the curves.

- ycol:

  `character`. The name of the column with observed values for the
  curves.

- t:

  `vector (numeric)`. Observation points at which we want to estimate
  the standard deviation of the error.

## Value

A data.table with two columns: `t` and `sig` corresponding to the
estimated standard deviation.
