\item{data}{\code{data.table (or data.frame)} or \code{list} of \code{data.table (or data.frame)} or \code{list} of \code{list}.
\itemize{
\item{If \code{data.table}}{
It must contain the raw binding of the curve observations with at least 3 columns.
\itemize{
\item{\code{idcol} :}{ The name of the column that contains the index of the curve in the sample.
Each index of a curve is repeated as many times as it has observation points.}
\item{\code{tcol} :}{ The name of the column that contains the observation points associated to each curve index.}
\item{\code{ycol} :}{ The name of the column that contains the observed value of a curve at each point of observation and for each index of the curve.}
}
}
\item{If \code{list} of \code{data.table}}{
In this case, each element of the given \code{list} corresponds to the observation scheme of a curve, which is given as \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame}.
The data.table contains at least 2 columns.
\itemize{
\item{\code{tcol} :}{ The name of the column that contains the observation points associated to the curve.}
\item{\code{ycol} :}{ The name of the column that contains the observed value of the curve.}
}
}
\item{If \code{list} of \code{list}}{
In the latter case, the \code{data} is a list \code{list} where each element is the observation scheme of a curve given as a \code{list} of 2 vectors.
\itemize{
\item{\code{tcol} :}{ The name of the vector that contains the observation points associated the curve.}
\item{\code{ycol} :}{ The name of the vector that contains the observed value of the curve.}
}
}

\item{idcol}{\code{character}. If \code{data} is given as \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame},
it is the name of the column that contains the index of the curve in the sample.
Each index of a curve is repeated as many times as it has observation points.
Opposite, if f \code{data} is given as \code{list} of \code{data.table (or data.frame)} of \code{list} of \code{list}, \code{idcol = NULL.}}

\item{tcol}{\code{character}. The name of the column (or vector) that contains the observation points associated to the curves.}

\item{ycol}{\code{character}. The name of the column that contains the observed value of the curves.}

\item{t}{\code{numeric (positive scalar)}. Observation point at which we want to estimate the mean function.}

\item{r}{\code{numeric (integer)}. It is used as exponent.}

\item{h}{\code{numeric (positive scalar)}. The bandwidth of the estimator.}

\item{smooth_ker}{\code{function}. The kernel function of the Nadaraya-Watson estimator. Default \code{smooth_ker = epanechnikov}.}

\value{
A \code{numeric} scalar.
